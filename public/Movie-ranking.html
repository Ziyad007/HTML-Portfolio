<h5>Favorite Dialogue</h5>
<p>Dilon mein tum apni betaabiyan leke chal rahe ho, toh zinda ho tum<br />
    Nazar mein khwaabon ki bijliyan leke chal rahe ho, toh zinda ho tum<br />
    Hawa ke jhokon ke jaise aazad rehna seekho<br />
    Tum ek dariya ke jaise lehron mein behna seekho<br />
    Har ek lamhe se tum milo khole apni baahein<br />
    Har ek pal ek naya samaa dekhe yeh nigahein<br />
    Jo apni aankhon mein hayraniyan leke chal rahe ho, toh zinda ho tum<br />
    Dilon mein tum apni betaabiyan leke chal rahe ho, toh zinda ho tum<br />
